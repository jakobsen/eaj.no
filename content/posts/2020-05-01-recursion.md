This i a sample markdown file with some `inline code`, as well as a code block:

```py
def hello_word(x):
    x += 1
    print('Hello World!')
```

We don't really need `x` in the above definition, but I want to see what color a variable is. This is a [link](#), by the way, so there's that. And this is a slightly longer paragraph, in case you are wondering what that is like. Write a very long senctence is kind of tricky when you have got nothing to say, but it turns out there is quite a bit to say about nothing – I suppose that is why there is so much bullshit on the internet.
