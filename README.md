My personal website, built from [Gatsby's hello world starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world). It is never done.

Feel free to fork it and build something cool, but please don't copy the content without linking back to me.

## Acknowledgements

[Tania Rascia](https://taniarascia.com) is an obvious inspiration for this site.
You should go read her articles and subscribe to her newsletter.

I learned how to make websites with the help of [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/), [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/), and the great courses on [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).

The tutorials on [Gatsby's website](gatsbyjs.org/) were indispensable in making my site.

Code syntax is rendered with [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/). I followed [Lekoarts' guide](https://www.lekoarts.de/en/blog/language-tabs-for-gatsbys-code-blocks) to add language flags to the code blocks.
